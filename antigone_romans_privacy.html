        <li>No personal information is collected by the developer.</li>
        <li>No scores or progress are sent to external developer servers.</li>
        <li>The app functions entirely on your device for core features.</li>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No data is stored or collected on our servers.</strong> The app works entirely
        offline for its primary function. Any potential session state (like progress or scores) exists only locally on
        your device and is not
        accessible by us.

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app integrates with third-party services for advertising to keep the app free. These services may collect
        information used to
        identify you according to their own policies.
