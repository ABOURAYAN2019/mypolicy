    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the
        FastCV Maker app handles your information. FastCV Maker is a mobile application built with Flutter that
        generates professional resumes and CVs using Artificial Intelligence.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>
        By using FastCV Maker, you agree to the practices described in this
        Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike our offline applications, FastCV Maker requires certain data to function, specifically to generate your
        CV and manage your account.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Personal Information for CVs:</strong> We collect the information you voluntarily input for your CV,
            such as your name, contact details, education history, work experience, and skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to secure your account. We may collect
            your email address if you sign in via email, or a unique identifier if you use anonymous login.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We track the number of CVs you generate to enforce the usage limit (currently 1
            CV per 30 days).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>CV Generation:</strong> The personal information you provide is used solely to generate your PDF
            resume.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI Processing:</strong> To create professional content, the text data you provide may be processed
            by third-party AI models (Google Gemini and DeepSeek).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Account Management:</strong> Your authentication data is used to maintain your session and save your
            preferences.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        FastCV Maker integrates with trusted third-party services to provide its core functionality.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for secure authentication and database storage. Use of Firebase is
            subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI Providers (Gemini & DeepSeek):</strong> Data required for CV generation is sent to these AI
            services. They process the data to generate text and recommendations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Your user profile and CV data are stored securely using Firebase cloud services. We retain this data so you can
        access and regenerate your CVs. You may request the deletion of your account and data at any time by contacting
        us.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. We only share information
        with third-party service providers (Firebase, Gemini, DeepSeek) to the extent necessary for them to provide
        their services (Authentication, Hosting, and AI Generation).
    </p>

    <h2>Usage Limits</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure fair usage and manage costs, the app enforces a limit of 1 CV generation per 30-day period per user.
        We store a timestamp of your last generation to implement this restriction.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        FastCV Maker is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

        directly on this page.
