  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the
    TinyQR app collects, uses, and protects your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using the TinyQR app, you agree to the practices described in this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>About TinyQR</h2>
  <p>
    TinyQR is an offline QR tool that lets you scan QR codes using your device
    camera and create QR codes locally on your device. All operations happen
    on-device without requiring any internet connection.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      QR scan results processed locally on your device (not transmitted).
    </li>
    <li>
      QR codes you generate are created locally and remain on your device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Anonymous analytics and crash reports (if enabled) to improve
      performance.
    </li>
    <li>If you contact us, we may collect your email and message content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide QR scanning and QR code generation features.</li>
    <li>To improve app performance, stability, and user experience.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal requirements and prevent misuse.</li>
    <li>
      No scan data or generated QR content is transmitted to external servers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Offline Processing</h2>
  <p>
    TinyQR operates entirely offline. QR code scanning and generation are
    processed locally on your device. No data is sent to external servers or
    cloud services.
  </p>

  <h2>Camera Access</h2>
  <p>
    For scanning QR codes, TinyQR may request access to your device camera.
    Camera access is used solely to detect and decode QR codes and is not used
    for any other purpose. No video or images are stored or transmitted.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    TinyQR does not store scan histories or generated QR content unless you
    explicitly save them to your device. Temporary processing data is
    discarded immediately after use.
  </p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    We may collect non-personal technical data such as device type, OS
    version, and crash logs. This data is anonymous and not linked to your
    identity or QR content.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    TinyQR does not use cookies. Third-party analytics (if used) may collect
    anonymized usage statistics only.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use trusted tools such as Firebase Analytics or Google
    Crashlytics. These services have their own Privacy Policies and comply
    with industry security standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can request access to any data stored about you.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of data stored locally by the app.</li>
    <li>You may opt-out of analytics by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

    personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will appear
    directly on this page.
